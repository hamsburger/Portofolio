# Portofolio

Hi, I am Harris Zheng.


I am a thinker, programmer, piano sheet music transcriber.  

I currently study Masters of Data Science at University of Michigan, previously studied Computer Engineering at University of Toronto. I love to learn how tools work and applying them to real world situations. Much of my experience comes from either industry work or personal projects where I gather data from kaggle, APIs, or web crawlers. 

# Get to Know Me

## Professional Experience

I have worked May 2021-June 2022 as a Data Analyst Intern at Geotab, an automotive company receiving TB of vehicle dataingested into Google Cloud. I worked on significant projects during my time there, building 
anomaly detection dashboards for problematic vehicle engine data and fixing database tables used by thousands of users. At Geotab,
I was able to build end-to-end data pipeline and learn both Data Analysis and Engineering skills such as database extraction, database modeling, query optimization, Airflow ETL, hypothesis testing, and dashboard building.

## Hobbies

I run a small piano sheet music business on Fiverr, where I take orders from casual players to professional librettists all around the world
to engrave audio into scripture. I'm also a piano player/songwriter/transcriptions, with releases on Spotify and MuseScore.
